    <h1>This Is My Practice Website (2022.03.27)</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Aaron Lindgren.  I have recently started on a journey to learn to code.</p>

    <p>This is my practice website.  I am going to try the things I learn on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> here.  My plan is to copy the entire thing to a new site every time I update it, that way I can track my own progress.</p>
    
    <p>Don't get discouraged by the current state of this site, I just started it and have spent about 45 minutes on it.</p>

    <h2>What I hope to accomplish through learning to code</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>More Skills (They can't take skills away)</li>
          <li>Higher paying job (Shit is expensive and raises at Camp, although consistent, are not great)</li>
          <li>Use my GIBill (Paid for it, may as well use it)</li>
          <li>Create an app for "That" (Just to throw the the word "that" up in random colors and fly away in random directions)</li>
          <li>Create an app that will sit in the background and automatically mute of half mute all commercials in stremaing services</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Turns out that many android apps are built in Java, and I hear that has a rather steep learning curve.  We'll get there, though.  </p>

    <h2>Updates (Mar 27th)</h2>
        <p>I have finished a couple more courses.  They seem to be getting easier, although I don't know if that is because of what I have learned or that the material is easier.  Perhaps a combination of both.  Before I move on to the Data Sciences course I am going to complete a few of the projects on here.  Some smaller ones first, then moving on to the larger, profile level projects.  I also took SQL already and will be taking Git/GitHub and their new Intro To Linux course.  That should be a piece of cake.</p>

        <p>I am curious if it is better to learn as many things as possible, or learn as few things as well as you can.  Although, that brings to mind this quote from Bruce Lee.</p>

        <p>Thinking of that, I think I will do the Linux and Git courses, then start the Data Scientist course.  Practice on projects after that, expand my "portfolio" as they say.</p>
